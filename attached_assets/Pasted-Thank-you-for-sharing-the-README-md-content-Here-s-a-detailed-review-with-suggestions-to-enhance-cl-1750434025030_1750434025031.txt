Thank you for sharing the README.md content. Here's a detailed review with suggestions to enhance clarity, professionalism, and usability for developers and collaborators.

✅ What's Good
The README already includes:

A strong project summary

Well-organized features

Clear technical stack

Setup instructions

A professional tone overall

⚠️ Suggestions for Improvement
1. Improve Markdown Formatting
Use headings, subheadings, and code blocks more effectively for readability.

2. Add Missing Sections
You should include:

Project Structure: Helps devs understand the file layout

API Documentation: Link to /docs

Running with Docker: Since you included a Dockerfile

License / Contribution Guidelines (optional but standard)

3. Fix Setup Instructions
The setup.py step is misleading—it's not common to run setup like that for a backend app unless you’re packaging it. Instead, recommend installing dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt.

✅ Recommended README.md Version
